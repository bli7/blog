    <h5>You want your sibling to join you in a game you're playing, but they still won't budge. What should you do?</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="subhead">
    <h5>Don't worry, many kids with autism are just starting from this stage. Here's a few tips to get your sibling to slowly start moving around! Note: we recommend you read the entire tutorial before getting started with Level 1, but you can also skim through it to look for answers to specific bolded questions.</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="specialhead">
  First Thing's First:
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
  Make a list of all the things your brother or sister likes. Include objects they love, foods they love to eat, and activities they love to do! This is your starting point. Make sure that with whatever activity you introduce them to in Level 1, you should be able to incorporate one or more of these "favorites" into it. Note: these goodies should not be freely available at other times, so that your sibling will look forward to them when they play with you!
  </div>
  <div class="example">
  Ex: If your brother likes sitting on the swing outside, you can go for a walk and ends with you both chilling on the swing.
  </div>
  <div class="example">
  Ex: If your sister really likes chocolate chip cookies, once you've both played for a certain amount of time on the Wii, enjoy a few cookies together.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
     The big idea here is: use what your sibling likes to get them to enjoy the activity with you!
  </div>
  <div class="specialhead">
    What should we do?
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    If you're going on a walk outside or in the mall, play a little game of I-Spy. Point out interesting things you see along the way, like a bright green van, or a teddy bear kiosk. Don't worry about whether they point anything out just yet. Right now, focus on keeping them engaged.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    If you're playing Wii, start off with the games that are least complicated. Wii sports resort is an excellent game to start off with, simply because of all the different options. The least difficult games there are basketball and swordfighting, while more moderately difficult games are bowling and table tennis.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    If your sibling doesn't want to play Wii at first, that's totally ok! Have them sit and watch you play for a few days. Interact with them while you play; you can show off your cool moves, or exchange high fives and comment on what you just did. Enjoy your victory with their favorite snack! Later on, you can try to include them by getting them to first hold remote while you help them navigate. Make sure to praise them for what they're doing!
  </div>
  <div class="specialhead">
    How long should we play for?
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    Before starting anything, determine the length of time your brother or sister will do the activity before wanting out. The idea is to start off easy, and increase the time gradually. After all, imagine if your teacher gave you a month's worth of coursework to finish in one day!
  </div>
  <div class="example">
    Ex: If your brother is willing to walk with you outside or in the mall for five minutes before he's done, you may want to keep the activity to 4 minutes or under. Same goes for playing Wii.
  </div>
  <div class="specialhead">
    But what if my sibling starts making noises while we're playing? What should I do then?
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    As we all know, some of our siblings with autism have a hard time communicating their feelings. They could be making noises for various reasons; sometimes, they could just be overwhelmed by the noises made by the game you're playing. In that case, you could decrease the volume to a more acceptable level.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    Sometimes, the screaming or waving hands could be to try to get out of the activity you both are doing. This is completely normal, and it's not because of you: they're just not used to moving around so much. By screaming or waving their hands, they're hoping you'll just give up on the activity altogether to get them to stop.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    How do we try to lessen the problem? Well, whenever your brother or sister starts showing these behaviors, look away without saying anything until they've calmed down. Wait a few seconds after they've become quiet, and then get them to do what you'd requested initially. When they do it, immediately praise them for participating! This would be a good time to give them their favorite treat.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
  These actions combined and practiced consistently will show your sibling that when they're quiet, good things happen to them. This will reduce the chance of the screaming behavior happening again.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    With these tips in mind, you should start either by selecting the activity in Level 1 that you think is best for the both of you, or by experimenting with two or all three activities. After 2-3 rounds of each activity you want to try, you can start having your sibling select for themselves which activity they want to do.
  </div>
  <div class="specialhead">
    Remember, this is just the beginning.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    It might seem boring now but we promise you, it'll totally be worth it when you and your sibling can play video games together or spend an afternoon at the mall, or anything else you've ever wanted to do but thought you couldn't.
  </div>
  <div class="advice">
    Best of luck! You've got this!
