          Alright, so you think you're ready to take the next step beyond ball-playing and walking around, and teach your sibling something REALLY out of the box, that no one ever thought you could!
          </div>
        <div class="subhead">
          Great! Except..where do you begin?
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          First Thing's First:
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          If you haven't already made a list of your sibling's favorite things, start from here. See if you can link one of your sibling’s "favorites" to baseball, badminton, or swimming. This will give you an activity to start out with.
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          Note: your sibling should already know how to swim before you take them swimming. If they don't then just skip this activity
        <div class="example">
          Ex: If your sibling is good at throwing/catching, then chances are they'll be good at baseball/tennis. If they play these sports on the Wii, then even better!
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          How long should we play for?
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          Since all three of these activities are going to be quite challenging for your sibling, consider how long they'll do the activity before they get tired, and subtract the time by 1 minute. This will be your starting time. You can always increase it as your sibling becomes more accustomed to the activity.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          If you don't have an idea, we recommend playing for 5 minutes to start out!
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          What should I do?
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        If you decide to start with tennis or baseball, first make sure your sibling is able to lift the racket. If they are. then you can guide them by putting your hand over theirs and helping them swing it properly. If not, have them go through the motions with a lighter object.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        Once they’ve swung a few times, let go and pantomime the motions by their side. Say "swing" whenever you want them to swing the racket, and if they don't respond after 10-15 secs, do the motion for them. This will lead them to understand that they have to swing the racket whenever you say "swing". If they tend to not pull their arm completely back when swinging, guide their arm back for them. Give them a piece of their favorite food after each correct motion they do by themselves.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        After they’ve mastered swinging the bat/racket, you can throw the ball/birdie to them from 3-4 feet away. Say "swing" whenever you want them to swing the bat/racket. It could take a few days, a few weeks, or even a few months, but they'll eventually recognize the word "swing" much quicker, and thus be able to swing the racket immediately after you tell them to. Once you've gotten them accustomed to at least one of the activities in Level 3, you can start introducing them to more!
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
        What if my sibling starts making noises/flapping their arms? What should I do then?
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        As we all know, some of our siblings with autism have a hard time communicating their feelings. They could be making noises for various reasons; sometimes, they could just be overwhelmed by the noises made by the game you're playing. In that case, you could decrease the volume to a quieter level.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        Sometimes, the screaming or waving of hands could be to escape the activity you both are doing. This is completely normal, and it's not because of you: they're just not used to moving around so much. By screaming or waving their hands, they're hoping you'll just give up on the activity altogether to get them to stop.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        How do we try to lessen the problem? Well, whenever your brother or sister starts showing these behaviors, look away without saying anything until they've calmed down. Wait a few seconds after they've become quiet, and then get them to do what you'd requested initially. When they do it, immediately praise them for participating! This would be a good time to give them their favorite treat.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        These actions combined and practiced consistently will show your sibling that when they're quiet, good things happen to them. This will reduce the chance of the screaming behavior happening again.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        While playing, it's important to remember that these are some of the hardest games a special-needs kid can learn. This not only combines hand-eye coordination, but also arm (or leg) strength and deliberate muscle movements, three skills children with autism have a higher difficulty "picking up" than any other kid. That’s why you should be proud of yourself for even getting this far!
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        There are going to be days when your sibling doesn't feel like doing anything at all, and that’s totally ok! What's important is that you keep it simple and fun, rather than try to cram in too many skills in a short amount of time! It'll be hard at first, but it's going to be so rewarding when you're able to show off your sibling’s new tennis skills at the family picnic!
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
        All the best. You've got this!
        </div>
