          Your sibling is already full of energy, and is ready to tackle some ball games. Awesome! Now where do you start?
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          Note: It's recommended to read the whole tutorial for Level 2, but if you want to just look at the answers to your specific questions, that's fine too.
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          First thing's first:
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          If you haven't already made a list of your sibling's favorite things, start from here. Think about which sports, if any, your sibling is interested in.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          The three button choices we have are soccer, basketball, and football, three of the simplest games to start learning. If your sibling is interested in any one of these sports, begin from there. Otherwise, start with just throwing and catching the football or bouncing the basketball.
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          How long should we play for?
        <div class="advice">
          It’s hard to designate a time limit for these kinds of ball-games, so we can start off by limiting the activity to ten throws and catches of the football, ten bounces of the basketball, or ten passes back-and-forth with the soccer ball. You can increase the amount of passes/throws/bounces by 5 every 2-3 sessions.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          I know this might seem a little boring at first, but don't worry! By starting off with this skill, you're helping your sibling develop the strength they'll need to start shooting baskets or scoring goals!
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          How should we start?
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          While passing/throwing, make sure to count out loud with your sibling, so they know they'll be finished after exactly [X] number of turns. If your sibling doesn't know their numbers yet, just count it out for them, and end when you told them you'd end.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          After you both are done, give your brother or sister a ton of praise, and add a little "reward" ( a food they like or breaktime in their favorite room of the house). You can pursue the same activity you started with tomorrow, or try something different if your sibling is up to it!
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          As with Level 1, once your sibling has enough experience with at least one of the activities in Level 2, you can have them start choosing for themselves what they want to do. Remember, even if you have some idea of what activity they like best, the point is to give them the power of communication.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          Congrats! You just took your first step towards success! Give yourself a well-earned pat on the back, because not everyone has the type of patience and dedication you have!
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          What if my sibling starts making noises/flapping their arms?
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          As we all know, some of our siblings with autism have a hard time communicating their feelings. They could be making noises for various reasons; sometimes, they could just be overwhelmed by the noises made by the game you're playing. In that case, you could decrease the volume to a more acceptable level.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          Sometimes, the screaming or waving hands could be to try to get out of the activity you both are doing. This is completely normal, and it’s not because of you: they're just not used to moving around so much. By screaming or waving their hands, they're hoping you'll just give up on the activity altogether to get them to stop.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          How do we try to lessen the problem? Well, whenever your brother or sister starts showing these behaviors, look away without saying anything until they've calmed down. Wait a few seconds after they've become quiet, and then get them to do what you’d requested initially. When they do it, immediately praise them for participating! This would be a good time to give them their favorite treat.
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          These actions combined and practiced consistently will show your sibling that when they're quiet, good things happen to them. This will reduce the chance of the screaming behavior happening again.
        </div>
        <div class="specialhead">
          It's important to remember that not every day is going to be a perfect day
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          There may be some days when your sibling doesn't want to get off of the couch, and others when they're eager to kick around a ball with you. The main thing is to never lose hope! It may take a long time for your sibling to learn a certain type of skill while they pick up others instantly. Whatever the case, it'll be super rewarding when you can show your parents, relatives, friends-whoever- that you were not only able to teach your sibling a cool new skill, but give them a chance to be like the other kids, and have a hobby they can keep for the rest of their life!
        </div>
        <div class="advice">
          Best of luck!
