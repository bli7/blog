      <a href="#" class="w3-bar-item w3-button">So this is for anyone whose brother or sister doesn't like to move around a lot. Don't worry, most special-needs kids, including Sunjana's brother, have started or will be starting from this stage. It's as simple as taking a walk in the park or in the mall! Here's a few tips to help you get started<br>- Use as little vocabulary as possible: Saying "C'mon, let's go for a walk" instead of "We're going to go to the park for some exercise" will register with them a lot better, and they'll know what's going on. <br>- If your sibling picks the 'walking in the neighborhood' image: Have fun with this! As you walk, point out cool things to them that are easy to spot from far away, such as a tall tree or a bright red car. Also, most importantly, you gotta make sure they don't run onto the road or into the neighbor's sprinklers(trust us it's happened), so you'll want to hold their hand tightly and keep them on the sidewalk.<br> -If your sibling picks the 'walking in the mall' image,  <br>-doing that though, since I copied and called the function..
